#Open AQ API Client Implementation

My implementation of an [OpenAQ API](https://docs.openaq.org/) client created as a [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) server app.

Currently, the functionality supports calling the ['Latest'](https://docs.openaq.org/v2/latest) GET request, as well as passing in a query string for a specific city, returning the latest air quality results of that city.

This was built as a minimum viable product for a technical task, so the features are sparse, it serves primarily as a proof of concept.
